QUIZ MANAGEMENT :

Section 1 - Project Description
1.1 Project
Quiz Application
1.2 Description
This project involves developing a clientserver quiz application where users can take quizzes on various subjects (Physics, Chemistry, and Math). The server stores quiz questions and manages the quiz state, while the client provides a user interface for selecting topics, answering questions, and displaying scores.
Section 2 - Overview
2.1 Purpose
The purpose of this module is to create an interactive quiz application that allows users to test their knowledge in different subjects. The intended audience is students and educators.
2.2 Scope
This module covers the client and server implementation for the quiz application, including the user interface design, question management, and score tracking.
2.3 Requirements
2.3.1 Functional Requirements

R1: The system shall allow users to select a quiz topic from Physics, Chemistry, or Math.
R2: The system shall display a series of 10 questions for the selected topic.
R3: The system shall allow users to answer each question.
R4: The system shall provide feedback on whether the answer was correct or incorrect.
R5: The system shall display the final score at the end of the quiz.
R6: The system shall include a countdown timer of 5 minutes for the quiz.

2.3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements describe how the system performs a function, focusing on aspects such as:
Performance: The system shall handle up to 100 concurrent users without performance degradation.
Reliability: The system shall have 99.9% uptime.
2.3.3 Technical Requirements

Hardware: The system shall run on servers with at least 8GB of RAM and 2 CPUs.
Software: The system shall be developed using Java and Swing for the client, and Java for the server.
2.3.4 Security Requirements

Data Encryption: All data transferred between client and server shall be encrypted using TLS.

Section 3 - System Architecture
3.1 Overview
The system consists of a client-server architecture where the client is responsible for the user interface and the server manages the quiz logic and data.


Section 4 - User Interface Design

4.1 User Interface Design Overview
The UI includes a topic selection screen, quiz question display, feedback for answers, and a final score display.

4.2 User Interface Navigation Flow
The navigation flow includes:
Topic Selection Screen → Quiz Question Screen → Final Score Screen

4.3 Use Cases / User Function Description
Use Case 1: User selects a quiz topic.
Use Case 2: User answers a series of 10 questions.
Use Case 3: User receives feedback on each answer.
Use Case 4: User views the final score.
Section 5 - Testing 
5.1 Test Plan Creation:
Components of a Test Plan:

- Objective: Validate the functionality and performance of the quiz application
- Scope: Includes functional testing, performance testing, and security testing.
- Resources: List the personnel, tools, and environments required.
- Schedule: Detail the timeline for testing activities.
- Test Cases: Define individual tests with steps, expected results, and actual results.

Section 6 - Monitoring
Monitoring is a critical component of maintaining the health, performance, and security of an application. It involves collecting, analyzing, and acting upon various metrics and logs to ensure the system operates smoothly and meets user expectations. In this section, define how and where it would be monitored, thresholds etc. 
Key metrics to monitor include:
- Performance Metrics: Response times, throughput, server load, CPU usage, memory usage.
- Error Metrics: Error rates, types of errors, affected users.
- Availability Metrics: Uptime, downtime, service availability.
- User Metrics: Active users, user sessions, retention rates.


Section 7 - Other Interfaces
7.1 Interface X
Interaction with external systems or APIs if applicable.
